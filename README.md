## Project Description📝


## Technologies Used 🔧

- **Oracle VM Virtual Box**:
- **Ubuntu 20.04**:

## Installation 🗺️

1. **Download VM**:
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. **Download Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu mate 20.04**:
    - To download Ubuntu 20.04: https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/
    - To download Ubuntu 20.04 Mate: https://releases.ubuntu-mate.org/20.04/amd64/

3. **Create the Virtual Machine**:
    - see the system requirements:
    - For Ubuntu 20.04: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements
    - For Ubuntu 20.04 Mate: https://ubuntu-mate.org/about/requirements/
     *We choose Ubuntu 20.04

4. **Setup Ubuntu 20.04 on Virtual Machine**:
     Open VM then enter New and write any name then through ISO image select other and open Ubuntu file.

5. **Setup ROS noetic on Ubuntu 20.04**:
    - Go to https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation and select your platform, we choose Ubuntu.
    - Open Terminal of Ubuntu to write commands to install ROS.
    - Setup your sources.list: Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org.
        ```sh
        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
        ```
    - Set up your keys:
       ```
        sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
       ```
       ```
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
       ```
- Make sure your package is up-to-date:
      ```
       sudo apt update
        ```
- Now pick how much of ROS you would like to install: Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended) : Everything in Desktop plus 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception packages.
       ```
        sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
        ```
- There are even more packages available in ROS. You can always install a specific package directly.
        ```
        sudo apt install ros-noetic-PACKAGE
        ```
        e.g.
        ```
        sudo apt install ros-noetic-slam-gmapping
        ```
- To find available packages, see https://index.ros.org/packages/page/1/time/#noetic or use:
       ```
        apt search ros-noetic
        ```
- You must source this script in every bash terminal you use ROS in:
     ```
        source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
      
- To test if ROS has been installed successfully or not:
     ```
        roscore
    ```
    - if you see meassage contain "SUMMARY" that means you intall ROS noetic successfully and it is running now.
6. **Setup ROS2 foxy on Ubuntu 20.04**:
    - Go to https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html .
    - Open Terminal of Ubuntu to write commands to install ROS2 foxy.
    - Set locale:
     ```
     locale  # check for UTF-8
       sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
       sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
       sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
       export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
       locale  # verify settings
     ```
- Setup sources: You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system
    ```
    sudo apt install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    ```
- Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```
- Then add the repository to your sources list:
```
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```
- Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories:
```
sudo apt update
```
- ROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated Ubuntu systems. It is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages.
```
sudo apt upgrade
```
- Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials:
```
sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop python3-argcomplete
```
- Development tools: Compilers and other tools to build ROS packages:
```
sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
```
- Set up your environment by sourcing the following file through nano editor:
```
nano .bashrc
```

```
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```
then exit from nano editor by press ctrl x.

- Try some example: If you installed ros-foxy-desktop above you can try some examples.

In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ talker:
```
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```
In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python listener:
```
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```
You should see the talker saying that it’s Publishing messages and the listener saying I heard those messages. This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
