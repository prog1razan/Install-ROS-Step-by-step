## Installation üó∫Ô∏è

1. **Download VM**:
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. **Download Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu mate 20.04**:
    - To download Ubuntu 20.04: https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/
    - To download Ubuntu 20.04 Mate: https://releases.ubuntu-mate.org/20.04/amd64/

3. **Create the Virtual Machine**:
    - see the system requirements:
    - For Ubuntu 20.04: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements
    - For Ubuntu 20.04 Mate: https://ubuntu-mate.org/about/requirements/
     *We choose Ubuntu 20.04

4. **Setup Ubuntu 20.04 on Virtual Machine**:
     Open VM then enter New and write any name then through ISO image select other and open Ubuntu file.

5. **Setup ROS on Ubuntu 20.04**:
    - Go to https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation and select your platform, we choose Ubuntu.
    - Open Terminal of Ubuntu to write commands to install ROS.
    - Setup your sources.list: Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org.
        ```sh
        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
        ```
    - Set up your keys:
       ```
        sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
       ```
       ```
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
       ```
- Make sure your package is up-to-date:
      ```
       sudo apt update
        ```
- Now pick how much of ROS you would like to install: 
-Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended) : Everything in Desktop plus 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception packages
        ```sh
        sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
        ```
- There are even more packages available in ROS. You can always install a specific package directly.
        ```
        sudo apt install ros-noetic-PACKAGE
        ```
        e.g.
        ```
        sudo apt install ros-noetic-slam-gmapping
        ```
- To find available packages, see https://index.ros.org/packages/page/1/time/#noetic or use:
       ```
        apt search ros-noetic
        ```
- You must source this script in every bash terminal you use ROS in:
     ```
        source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
      
- To test if ROS has been installed successfully or not:
     ```
        roscore
    ```
if you see meassage contain "summary" that means you intall ROS successfully and it is running now.
